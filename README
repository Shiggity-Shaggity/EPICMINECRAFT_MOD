code.java equals I hate java with a burning passion and I have no idea why notch thought it was a good idea to make minecraft using Java
but, on the other hand, Microsoft has destroyed the god tier game of Minecraft, so, if ur a real gamer, you play Java Edition. if you play
String minecraftversion = "bedrock edition";
System.out.println(H);

bedrock edition, you are a fake gamer.

if(minecraftversion == "bedrock edition"){
  System.out.println("you aren't even a gamer");
}else if(minecraftversion == "java edition"){
  System.out.println("realgamerhours");
}
